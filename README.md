# App-Development Test
At Floatplane our user-facing applications are built using MobX for state management and React for UI elements. We have a strong emphasis on keeping data and rendering code separate. We also use Typescript with very strict typing rules.

Write a simple example of a React and MobX application to show an infinite scroll-to-load feed of posts from a floatplane creator. It doesnâ€™t need to be anything fancy, but does need to be presentable.

Endpoints: Use those endpoints to get a list of creators and then the posts per creator. The query parameters are example values in bold.
